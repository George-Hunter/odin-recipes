    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Tabbouleh is a simple and super fresh salad that's made of parsley, tomatoes, and bulgur grain.
        It is an absolute staple in Lebanese cuisine and a delicious meal.
    </p>

    <p>This salad is packed with flavor from very few ingredients. It's so fresh and light
        that makes it work as a side salad for most meals, especially other Mediterranean dishes,
        like Kefta and samke Harra. Bulgur is traditionally found in authentic Lebanese Tabouli, it's
        a grain that we use in other dishes as well, such as Kibbeh.
